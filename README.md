# Linux Server Setup for Minecraft and Steam
This is just the project repository for server-setup-lin. DO NOT CLONE THIS REPO FOR YOUR SERVER

To obtain the setup.sh on your server do: 

`curl https://noahcou.github.io/fishcurl/bash/server/setup.sh -o serversetup ; chmod +x serversetup`

All you need is the setup.sh

It is recommended to do that in your `~/` directory

- [x] Fix sudo security issues
- [ ] Maybe add chown for fixing file ownership issues that may occur
- [ ] Add a way to update minecraft servers 2 (vanilla auto-move)(this one might not happen because I am lazy)
