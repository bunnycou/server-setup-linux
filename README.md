# Linux Server Setup for Minecraft and Steam

This is just the project repository for server-setup-lin. DO NOT CLONE THIS REPO FOR YOUR SERVER

To obtain the setup.sh on your server do:

`curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bunnycou/server-setup-linux/main/setup.sh -o setupservers ; chmod +x setupservers`

All you need is the setup.sh

It is recommended to do that in your `~/` directory
