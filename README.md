# Linux Server Setup for Minecraft and Steam
This is just the project repository for server-setup-lin. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS FOR YOUR SERVER

To obtain the setup.sh on your server do `curl https://noahcou.github.io/fishcurl/bash/server/setup.sh -o setup.sh`

All you need is the setup.sh

It is recommended to do that in your `~/` directory
